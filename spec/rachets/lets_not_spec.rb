      It looks like you added a new usage of 'let!'. We expected #{expected_usages}, but found #{actual_usages}.
      Please change your test setup to use local variables, a regular ruby method, or some other approach.
      For more background and ideas on alternative approaches see https://thoughtbot.com/blog/lets-not and https://thoughtbot.com/blog/my-issues-with-let.

      And if you really must use let!, you can increase EXPECTED_USAGES in the #{__FILE__}.

      You removed a usage of let! We previously had #{expected_usages}, but found #{actual_usages}.
      Thank you for helping us work towards more explicit and maintainable specs.
      Please change 'expected_usages' in #{__FILE__} to #{actual_usages} to continue to rachet this down."
