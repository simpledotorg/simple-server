  # FIXME(:selected_period): Write out JS for this component's interactivity.
  # The whole current period thing only works onMount — sticking to frontend
  # terms here — after then, it's useless. This is because a view-component in
  # Rails, which this is, is technically a server-side render scoped to its own
  # local variables, and exposing methods as callable from the view. It doesn't
  # handle state.  This means interactivity cannot be handled at the view
  # component layer. In lay man's terms, when someone selects another quarter
  # to view, we need to do a full page refresh if we are depending on the view
  # component; a full page refresh passing in the selected quarter. We need JS
