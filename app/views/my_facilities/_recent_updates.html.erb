        <b>SMS Patient reminders:</b> Simple is again sending text messages to all patients with upcoming appointments to remind them to return to care &#8212; patients receive a message 1 day before, day of, and 3 days after their appointment, if they don't come.

      <b>Bug fix:</b> When you print reports, the charts no longer go over the edge of the cards.

      The <b>Dashboard</b> now defines lost-to-follow-up patients more accurately. Previously a patient was LTFU if they did not have a BP measure in &gt;1 year. Now a patient is LTFU if they didn't have a BP measure, a blood sugar measure, a medication refill, or a new appointment scheduled in &gt;1 year.
