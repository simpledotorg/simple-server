class Messaging::Channel
  # Note on error handling: Any messaging channel implementation should raise
  # errors from the channel's API as exceptions. This is to allow background jobs to
  # retry in case of network/limit errors. The error object should contains the reason of
  # failure if it was due to a known error so that users of the service can use it
  # to handle known errors properly.
