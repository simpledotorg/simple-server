# This is the entity. From a data perspective, this entity is complete as is.
# However, there is logic layered on this entity which does not allow it be
# complete by itself. Other "logical" entities are layered ontop of this one to
# make the feature complete. So while vaildations may pass, the entity may
# still be functionally unusable if used by itself. If you want to create an
# indicator, look to one of the child classes.
