# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        # API specification for RedApp
        ## Sync APIs
        This API spec documents the endpoints that the devices (that are offline to varying levels) will use to sync data. The sync end points will send and receive bulk (a list of) entities. Both sending and receiving can be batched with configurable batch-sizes to accommodate low network bandwidth situations.
        ## Nesting resources
        The APIs have been designed to provide an optimal balance between accuracy and simplicity. Some of the APIs (patients) will be nested, and some other (blood pressures) will be flat.
        ## Authentication
        TODO

        ## Sync Mechanism
        Refer to the [related ADR](https://github.com/resolvetosavelives/redapp-server/blob/master/doc/arch/001-synchronization.md).
