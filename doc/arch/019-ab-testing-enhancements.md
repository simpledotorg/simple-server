# A/B Testing Framework enhancements

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our first attempt at [A/B testing notifications](./017-ab-testing.md) surfaced some concerns:
- The patient selection mechanism selected patients across multiple treatment groups, and patients were excluded
  incorrectly due to past experiments.
- There were inconsistencies in how notifications were dispatched, which resulted in some patients only
  receiving a subset of the message cascade.
- There are issues with how appointments are being recorded in the mobile app which affects how visits are counted.

These inconsistencies make reporting complicated and reduce the quality of experiment data.
These issues impact the validity of the experiment and need to be addressed before we rerun the first experiment and run subsequent experiments.

## Decision

### Patient Selection a.k.a Enrollment
- We will enforce treatment group membership constraints. Patients should not have multiple treatment group memberships in active experiments.
- Patients who have multiple scheduled appointments will not be included in the experiment.
- All experiments (including completed ones) will have start and end dates - we accidentally excluded a large number of patients from the experiments by not enforcing this constraint.
- Select patients close to their expected visit date. Selecting patients too far in advance increases the likelihood of the patient's state changing before their expected visit.

### Patient eviction
Patients may need to be evicted from the experiment as the experiment progresses. Evicting a patient from the experiment means that they will not be sent any pending messages, and will be excluded from the results. We will evict patients:
1. who had a new appointment created or their original appointment updated without a corresponding visit (i.e, no bp, blood sugar, or prescription drug was recorded).
  This is to avoid tracking their new expected visit date and moving their notifications to the correct date, which will introduce noise in the results.
  A nurse can update a patient’s appointment from the app and change its status or scheduled date.
  In this case the patient’s expected return date becomes unclear because the appointment they were enrolled in the experiment for is no longer relevant.
  This can also happen if an accidental appointment with a different scheduled date was created.
2. where we failed to send a notification. This could happen if we have a invalid number or due to network failures.

### Tracking visits
- The start date for monitoring return visits for each patient should be the date of enrollment in an experiment (and treatment group).
- The end date for monitoring return visits for each patient should be 14 days from their appointment’s scheduled date.

We will not infer visits from the creation of appointments. We will rely on Blood Pressures, Blood Sugars and Prescription Drugs only.
Note that this is only in experimentation, and we will not make any changes to the existing dashboards/reports that infer visits using appointments.

**Rationale**: A portion of our appointment records are created due to bugs and problematic UI flows.
This makes it impossible to distinguish real visits from accidentally created appointments.

**Consequences**: Excluding appointment creation from our criteria will mean that our experiment patients’ total visits will be ~10% lower than the numbers we report on the dashboard.
This will not affect the validity of our results since this ~10% reduction will be distributed uniformly across the treatment groups.
Since this may lead to us undercounting visits, we will need to report relative improvements in return rates rather than absolute percentages.
For example, if cascade group patients have a 20% return rate and control group patients have a 15% return rate, we should look at the difference here, which is 5% and not the absolute percentages.


### Reporting
We will store the results of the experiment in a denormalized format that is close to our final reporting needs.
- The reporting schema will be tied to a treatment group membership.
- We will populate it everyday by scanning the previous day’s activity.
- Any new metrics that we want to track will need to be added to this table.

We will use the same database table to track membership, and the experiment related activity on each membership.
Although it might appeal to separate the notion of "membership" from "reporting" on them, we currently do not see a need to separate the tables.
Using the same table and domain model simplifies the design significantly.
Additionally, a "membership_report" table would essentially be a superset of the "membership" table, and reporting over (joining) two large data tables is not performant.
If there is divergence in the reporting needs of various experiments, we will revisit this decision.

### Experiment timeline

We currently capture an experiment's timeline by storing a `state` field. The `state` can be
`upcoming`, `running` and `completed`. There are more cadences to the experiment though, which aren't captured
well by this attribute alone. For example
- Notifications are sent out until 3 days after enrollment ends.
- Patients need to be monitored till 14 days after enrollment ends.

The cadences when put on a timeline look like:

![ab-experiment-timeline](https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-server/raw/5a4008a79e1cffd635b2ce2348ec1b9dea5318e9/doc/arch/resources/ab_experiment_timeline.png)

Additionally, the `state` attribute needs to be tracked every day and modified when the state changes.
The `start_time`, `end_time`, and buffers already have all the information required to compute the cadences.
We will remove the `state` field and introduce methods that work with `start_time` and `end_time` to compute each cadence.

### Object design, and separation of concerns

The [experiment flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IMXu_ca9xKU8Xox_3v403ZdvNGQzczLWljy7LQ6RQ6A/edit#)
procedurally describes all the steps involved in running an experiment. Currently these responsibilities are shared by
`Experimentation::Experiment` and `Experimentation::Runner`. We will refactor them into the following classes:

| Class |  Responsibility |
| :--- | :----------- |
| `Experimentation::Experiment` | Setup experiments and assign treatment groups integrally. |
| `Experimentation::TreatmentGroup` | Describes a treatment group and the behaviour for the patients in it. |
| `Experimentation::TreatmentGroupMembership` | Stores the patients membership in a treatment group and collects related data. |
| `Experimentation::ReminderTemplate` | Specifies what messages need to be sent to which treatment group and when. |
| `Experimentation::NotificationsExperiment` | Specifies the default eligibility criteria and conducts a notifications experiment. |
| `Experimentation::CurrentPatientExperiment` | Specifies the eligibility criteria for selection and conducts a current patient experiment. |
| `Experimentation::StalePatientExperiment` | Specifies the eligibility criteria for selection and conducts a stale patient experiment. |

### FAQs
- Why split `Experiment` and `NotificationsExperiment`?
`Experiment` has significant responsibilities in maintaining integrity across experiments and providing an API for the timeline.
And `NotificationsExperiment` handles all "notification" related aspects of an experiment including day to day operations.

- Why create subclasses for individual experiments? The individual experiments will be subclassed from `NotificationsExperiment`
since they have enough shared behaviour but have different selection and notifying behaviours.

## Consequences
- The `Experiment` hierarchy, and the reporting schema assumes we will only ever run notification experiments.
  If we have other kinds of experiments in the future, we will have to rethink some of this design.
- The reporting schema assumes that all experiments will have the same reporting needs.
  If the needs differ, we might have to augment or modify the schema as required.
  And if the reporting needs are entirely different, we might have to separate the membership tables from the reporting tables.
- The membership and monitoring buffers are currently hard coded and common for all experiments. Updating the code will apply the buffer to existing experiments as well, which might have consequences on the integrity of the experiment.
  We might want to store these into the experiment model if these become pressing concerns.
- The constraint between buffers, next_membership > monitoring > last_notification is not enforced. Updating the code might have consequences on the integrity of the current experiments.
