  Fix Bundler plugin path so it points to the shared path instead of a release path -- this fixes a deep, painful issue between Rubygems,
  Bundler plugins, and bootboot. See https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-server/pull/3268 for some related issues here and to see
  if there are better fixes that happen upstream so we don't need this hack anymore.
